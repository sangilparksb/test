An ECS instance is the minimal unit  that can provide computing services for your business. It provides computing capabilities at a certain specification.

##Instance type family
ECS instances can be divided into multiple specification types, based on the business and usage scenarios. In the same business scenario, you can select multiple new or old type families.

In the same type family, there are also multiple types based on the CPU and memory configuration.

##Instance type
An ECS instance type defines two basic attributes: the instance CPU and memory configuration (including CPU model and clock speed). However, the <a href="https://intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/25382.htm" target="_blank">disks</a>, <a href="https://intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/25389.htm" target="_blank">images</a>, and <a href="https://intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/25385.htm" target="_blank">network</a> attributes of the ECS instance should also be defined at the same time, for the specific service form of the instance to be determined.

##The latest type family
All the ECS instances of the latest type family are I/O-optimized. You can choose the following three types of disks for them:

- SSD cloud disk
- Ultra cloud disk
- Basic cloud disk

The SSD cloud disks and ultra cloud disks are recommended, to enjoy optimal storage I/O performance.

------------------------------------------

Instances can be divided into the following type families based on the business scenarios.

####Phasing-out instance types
The phasing-out instance types include: T1, T2, S1, S2, S3, M1, M2, C1, and C2.
All these instance types are legacy shared instance types. They are still categorized using the previous method (that is, by the number of cores - 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 cores) and are not sensitive to type families.
#####Features
- 2.6 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2650 v2 processors are adopted.
- The latest DDR3 memory.
- I/O-optimized and non I/O-optimized at your choice.

#####I/O-optimized instance types
I/O-optimized instances support two types of disks:
- SSD cloud disk 
- Ultra cloud disk

####Configuration change between different type families 
- You can change the configuration among the three shared instance type families (N1, N2, E3), and within the same instance type family.  
- You can change the configuration among the nine shared instance type families (T1, T2, S1, S2, S3, M1, M2, C1, and C2), and within the same instance type family.
