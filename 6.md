# Switch the CIDR block for an RDS instance in a VPC

Assume a VPC has two VSwitches with the CIDR blocks 172.16.0.0/24 and 172.18.0.0/24 respectively. An RDS instance mounted to the VSwitch at 172.16.0.0/24 can be switched to the VSwitch at 172.18.0.0/24.

> **Note**:

> - A change to the IP address instantly disconnects the RDS instance. It is recommended that you set an automatic reconnection mechanism for the RDS program.

> - The new IP address must be added to the RDS white list.


## Procedure

1. Log on to the [Alibaba Cloud RDS console](https://rdsnew.console.aliyun.com/console/index#/rdsList/cn-hangzhou/basic/ "RDS console"), and select a region.

1. To switch the RDS instance from the VPC to a classic cloud, follow the following steps.

Note the following:

* A change of the IP address will cause an instant disconnection of the RDS instance.

* The new IP address must be added to the RDS white list.

* You must set an automatic reconnection mechanism for the RDS program beforehand.
