## Application scenarios

* You need an isolated and secure network environment.

* You need to have full control over your VPC, such as specifying the IP address range, Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) blocks, route tables and gateways.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that you have created an Alibaba Cloud account. Refer to [Register an account](~~27709~~) for more details.
- Ensure that you are aware of the IP address range and other VPC related concepts. Refer to [Product overview](~~34217~~) for more details.

## Procedure

1. Log on to the  [Alibaba Cloud VPC Console](https://vpc.console.aliyun.com/?spm=5176.2020520152.1002.d10vpc.BstuhB#/overview/resources "Alibaba Cloud VPC Console").

2. In the VPC left-side navigation bar, click **VPC** to open the VPC management page.

3. On the VPC management page, click the region where the VPC is created and then click **Create VPC**.

4. In the displayed **Create VPC** window, complete the following steps:

	1. Enter a VPC name and select a CIDR block from the drop-down list to specify the network IP range. Click **OK**.

	**Note**:
	
		- Only one CIDR block can be assigned to a VPC. You can specify a CIDR block from the following address ranges:
			- 10.0.0.0 / 8 and subnets
			- 172.16.0.0 / 12 and subnets (This is the default CIDR block address.)
			- 192.168.0.0 / 16 and subnets
	
		- The CIDR block cannot be modified.

	2. View your VPC information and click **OK** to close the **Create VPC** window. By default a VRouter is created when the VPC is created.

5. The created VPC is displayed on the VPC management page. Click  **Refresh** to refresh this page. When status of the VPC is changed to **Available**, it indicates that the VPC is correctly created.
